# React Boilerplate

This is a simple and lightweight boilerplate for react to learn the ins and outs of npm packages, Webpack (future addition) and, node modules such as `child_processes.exec()` and such and truly understanding the beauty of create-react-app.

## Features

-   React.JS `v17`
-   React supporting libraries (react-router-dom)
-   Very basic folder structure

## Getting started

Clone the repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/abrahym-sharfeldden/react-boilerplate
```

In the terminal, navigate to the directory you just cloned. In order to use this project with Node's package manager, the repository must first be linked to npm use the following command:

```bash
npm link
```

Now you can use the boilerplate anywhere on your machine with the following command:

```bash
npx react-boilerplate <projectName>
```

or

```bash
npx rbp <projectName>
```

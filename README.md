# React Boilerplate

This is a simple and lightweight boilerplate for react to avoid the bloatedness of create-react-app.

## Features

-   React.JS `v17`
-   React supporting libraries (react-router-dom)
-   Very basic folder structure

## Getting started

Clone the repository to your machine:
```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/abrahym-sharfeldden/react-boilerplate```

In the terminal, navigate to the directory you just cloned. In order to use this project with Node's package manager, the repository must first be linked to npm use the following command:
```npm link```

Now you can use the boilerplate anywhere on your machine with the following command:
```npx react-boilerplate projectName```
or
```npx rbp projectName```

## Future Upgrades
- Switching from react-scripts to webpack
- Include a boilerplate for tests using Jest
- Include a reset.css to reduce inconsistencies between browsers
- Include a css autoprefixer
